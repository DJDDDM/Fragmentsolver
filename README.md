# Fragmentsolver
Fragmentsolver is a tool for computing the restricted Hartree Fock energy given a Fragment as Input in form of a FCIDUMP.
The current FCIDUMP is build from water but you can replace it with your FCIDUMP.
A FCIDUMP is a list of one- and two-electron integrals as well as the nuclear Energy.
Molpro and Cryscor can be use to create new FCIDUMPs.
If you just want to try out you can also take one of the FCIDUMPs from the FCIDUMPs folder.

Some mathematical background behind this algorithm can be found in the workingequations file.
